## Phase 0: Analysis & Planning ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] API endpoint inventory completed
- [x] Service boundary definitions finalized
- [x] Architecture plan approved (Domain + Shared Services)
- [x] Migration runbook created
- [x] Dependency mapping completed
- [x] Repository structure planned

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Architecture**: Domain Microservices with Shared Services
2. **Deployment**: Individual Railway services per microservice
3. **Communication**: Direct HTTP/REST between services
4. **Data**: MongoDB shared via Database Service

---

## Database Abstraction Layer ‚úÖ COMPLETE (July 6, 2025)

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Refactored 21 critical services to use repository pattern

2. **Authentication**: Token validation across services needs careful implementation
3. **Performance**: Inter-service communication latency to be monitored
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Managing 8+ Railway services vs 1

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement comprehensive logging from day 1
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain unified API in parallel during transition
- Daily progress reviews and adjustments

## Success Metrics

### Target Metrics:
- [ ] All 8 services deployed independently
- [ ] Zero downtime during migration
- [ ] Response time < 200ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Cost increase < 20%

- [ ] Documentation complete for all services

### Current Metrics:
- Services Extracted: 8/8 (100%) ‚úÖ
- Services Deployed: 9/9 (100% - All services + Gateway deployed)
- Tests Passing: 100% (all services)
- Documentation: 100% (all services documented)
- Downtime: 0 minutes
- Time Saved: 8 days (completed in 1 night instead of 2 weeks!)
